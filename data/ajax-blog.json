  "content": "So, 50 years. That's 18,262 and a half days. Pretty insane if you think of it. It's a big number, but not really. It seems like it'd be more. So many days, I've wanted to be over and wish weeks were over. At the supposed half way point, I think that I'm not going to take as many of these for granted because most likely there won't be 18,000 more days left. There will be less. Or they won't be as good. Or who knows, maybe they will be better.  Like the South American palm reader said.  I'll have a hard first half of the life and then something will happen and it'll be good. I have a great daughter who turned out pretty good. I've got a great wife. My mom and my grandmother are still with us and I see them when I can. I want for nothing. Other than hoping that the code clicks a little quicker. I had high hopes of having a grand party or going somewhere fun, but in the end, I'm still here and kicking. It could be worse.",
